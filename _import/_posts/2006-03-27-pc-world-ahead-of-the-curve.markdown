Well looks like PC World have managed to pull off a bit of a coup - but they're keeping it a bit quiet.  Whilst some have <a href="http://www.onmac.net/">managed</a> to get Windows XP running on the new Intel based Mac's, PC World have managed to get Mac OS X running on non Apple based kit - at least if their new advert in the UK is anything to go by!  The advert I saw on E4 last night shows the PC World website running on the Compaq notebook PC.  Their web browser of choice? Apple's Safari browser! :)  Well at least now they're admitting OS X is a better operating system to run!! :)
