# What I'm doing now

Here are the things that I'm currently focussing on:

* Spending time with my family
* Running my business [Foxsoft Ltd](http://www.foxsoft.co.uk)
* Running the beaver colonies at [1st Hopwas Scouts](http://www.1sthopwasscouts.org.uk/beavers/) as an Assistant Beaver Leader
* DYFC course
* 30 Day Writing Challenge
* Exercising 3x a week (mostly kettlebells and rowing)
* Reading books for improving myself and pleasure
* Building LEGO


I have lots of other ideas and things that I want to do but these take up all my time at the moment. When my activities and priorities change, I'll update this page.
