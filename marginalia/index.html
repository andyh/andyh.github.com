<h1>Marginalia</h1>
<p>
<em>
  Articles take time to prepare and many don't see the light of day. Marginalia
  are the notes, quotes, ideas and thoughts that never (or haven't yet) made it
  to a full article. Like my friends, <a href="https://marcjenkins.co.uk/notes/">Marc</a> and <a href="https://daveredfern.com/notes/">Dave</a> I realised there's value in
  sharing these too. It also gives me a place to put more fully-formed ideas
  that don't fit into the main articles section.

<ul class="posts-archive">
  {% for note in site.marginalia %}
    <li>
    <a href="{{ note.url }}"><h3>{{ note.title }}</h3></a>
      {{ note.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
