          <p><img src='/images/elephant-drawing-small.jpg' alt='An elephant I drew when I was thirteen' /> I&#8217;ve always enjoyed art and design and wasn&#8217;t too bad at it, though never quite as good as I wanted to be. For quite a while through high school I was interested in becoming an Architect hopeful that it would satisfy my desire to mix science/engineering with art/design. My interest in computers won through and until the last couple of years, whilst I still dabbled in the design side of things, my focus had been much more on the logical, engineering side. Now though, I&#8217;m enjoying getting involved in design tasks again and it&#8217;s also informing my programming in many ways. (This is something I&#8217;m hoping to cover more in future posts.)</p>

<p>One thing has always passed me by though, and that&#8217;s typography. I&#8217;ve never really paid much attention to it, but since watching a documentary by Stephen Fry on Gutenberg a few months ago I&#8217;ve become fascinated with it. With credit card in hand I made my way to Waterstones and visited the design section. I picked up <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1856694372'>Type &amp; Typography (Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam)</a> as well as <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321534050'>The Non-Designer&#8217;s Design and Type Books, Deluxe Edition (Robin Williams)</a>. A slight detour via the science fiction section, a few moleskines and a lighter bank balance and I&#8217;m on my way home.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d start with Robin Williams (not the comedian) book to brush up on my design skills and get a gentler introduction to type. Overall, I was very impressed with the book. It was an easy read and it really got the information over well, I highly recommend you buy a copy. Eager to put my new-found skills and inspired by Amy Hoy&#8217;s <a href='http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/11/3/stuff-you-can-download'>cheatsheets</a> I thought I would put together my own on design principles.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;ve broken a few design rules in putting it together but my aim was to illustrate some of the <em>Don&#8217;ts</em> as well as the <em>Do&#8217;s</em>. That said, I would really appreciate any feedback or criticism you may have on the overall design and the typefaces I chose along with any tips you might have for improvement. Any recommendations for books or other resources are also most welcome. <a href='http://www.elaptics.co.uk/assets/design-principles-cheatsheet.pdf'><img src='/images/design-principles-cheatsheet-tm.jpg' alt='Design Principles Cheatsheet' /></a></p>
