<p>
  I live and work in Tamworth, near Birmingham (pretty much our only claim to fame is an indoor real-snow ski slope). You could say I’m obsessed with computers and you’d probably be right.
</p>

<p>
  I have a wonderful wife and two amazing children. I run a small software
  consultancy, <a href="http://www.foxsoft.co.uk/">Foxsoft Ltd</a>, where we
  help businesses to become more productive and profitable by building software
  systems that have a measurable impact.
</p>

<p>
A big fan of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org" rel="nofollow">Ruby</a> programming language, I organize our local <a href="http://www.wmrug.org">West
  Midlands Ruby User Group</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a keen cyclist - of the lycra-wearing variety - and I enjoy photography when I get the chance.
</p>

<p>Oh, and I also use vim &mdash; sorry</p>

<p>
If you want to get in touch with me, I can be found on the <a href="http://twitter.com/elaptics" rel="nofollow">twitters</a> or
<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewjhenson" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. I don't do Facebook though. And if you want to check out my code, take
a look at <a href="http://github.com/andyh" rel="nofollow">Github</a>. You can
always <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:andy@elaptics.co.uk">email</a> me too.
