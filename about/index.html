<p>Born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham" rel="nofollow">Birmingham, UK</a>. I've been building web applications for over
ten years. I love all things open source and code wise Ruby is my language of choice, vim my editor.</p>

<p>I have a degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Aberystwyth university</a>.
I worked as a PHP developer before becoming a Ruby on Rails developer.
I am currently IT manager for one of the UK's online printer ink retailers, <a href="http://www.stinkyinkshop.co.uk">Stinkyink.com</a>.

<p>When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be out shredding mountain bike trials with my fantastic mates, or out enjoying a meal. I'm also known to enjoy computer games from time-to-time.</p>

<p>You can contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/RichGuk" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> (or <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:&#114;&#105;&#099;&#104;&#064;&#114;&#105;&#099;&#104;&#103;&#114;&#117;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a>) and can view my code / projects on <a href="http://github.com/RichGuk" rel="nofollow">Github</a>.</p>




  <p>I have a wonderful wife and two amazing children. I run a small software consultancy, <a href="http://www.foxsoft.co.uk/">Foxsoft Ltd</a>, helping businesses to improve through software.</p>
  
  I live and work in Tamworth, near Birmingham (pretty much our only claim to fame is an indoor real-snow ski slope). You could say I’m obsessed with computers and you’d probably be right.  My current focus is on web development and lately I’m particularly keen on good design and simplicity.

            I probably drink too much coffee and don’t do as much exercise as I should.
