<div class="post">
  <p>Several of the other participants in <a href="http://marcjenkins.co.uk/30dwc">30DWC</a> have shared their morning routines so I thought it would be good to document mine too.</p>

<p>Your routine doesn’t need to be set in stone. I’ve been experimenting with different routines for the last year or so. It will continue to evolve as I learn what works well for me and what doesn’t. As my <a href="/now">current focus</a> changes, my routine will no doubt be adjusted to fit.</p>

<h2 id="a-good-morning-starts-the-night-before">A good morning starts the night before</h2>

<p>The key to a good morning routine is preparation so my morning routine starts the night before. It starts at the end of the work day with a shutdown procedure, to tie up loose ends and plan out the tasks I’m going to do tomorrow. It allows me to mentally close off work for the day. Before I introduced this practice I would still be thinking about work problems into the evening and inevitably it would keep me awake much longer.</p>

<p>In order to wake early, I need to get to bed at a reasonable time. I’ve always been a bit of a night owl so training myself to become an early bird has taken some time and is still an ongoing effort. I aim to be in bed for around 10:30pm, to be asleep by 11pm so that I can wake and get up at 5:30am.</p>

<p>I aim to finish the evenings activities around 10pm when I get my daily reminder from Way of Life. I fill in my entries and that gives me a moment of reflection on the day and I use that to give me a little push to choose how tomorrow should look.</p>

<p>I will then grind some coffee beans and set out a mug, my cafetieré and fill the kettle ready for the morning. Upstairs I lay my clothes out ready by my bed so I can get dressed immediately on waking with no decisions to make.</p>

<p>I try to avoid using my phone or other electronic devices after around 9pm (with the exception of adding my Way of Life entries). Generally, unless I am really tired, I will read a magazine or some kind of fiction to relax and help my brain to turn off. Non-fiction gets me thinking too much so I read those earlier in the day instead.</p>

<p>Finally, I will lay my clothes out ready for the next day so I can get out of bed and immediately get dressed without needing to make any decisions or open wardrobes or drawers and risk waking the family.</p>

<h2 id="the-morning-after-the-night-before">The morning after the night before</h2>

<p>I aim to wake between 5am and 5:30am including on the weekends. I don’t usually set an alarm, preferring to wake naturally so that I get as much sleep as possible. I’ve been using <a href="http://sleepyti.me">sleepyti.me</a> to try and match my sleep time to circadian rhythms with mixed success. I get about 6 hours of sleep, on average, which I generally cope ok with but I do worry whether I’m really getting enough. However, I can’t seem to increase the duration with any reliability.</p>

<p>On waking, I get up and dressed immediately. On days when I’m writing, I’ll go downstairs and make coffee first. It’s just a simple ritual that helps me to wake more fully before meditating. I make sure not to start looking at my phone or otherwise get distracted.</p>

<p>When the coffee is brewed I return to my desk and begin my <a href="/journal/making-meditation-a-habit/">meditation session</a>.</p>

<p>After, my routine changes depending on the day. I exercise on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays and write on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. If we don’t have specific plans then I’ll try and write a little over the weekend too. I aim for 3 days of exercise a week so if I need to make other commitments, then I will change the days to ensure I meet my exercise target. Routines need to be flexible.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>

<p>My current exercise routine is simple but effective. It’s a kettlebell workout following Pavel Tsatsouline’s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G">Simple and Sinister</a> book which consists of just two exercises, the “hardstyle” kettlebell swing and the Turkish Get-Up. It only takes around 30 minutes, provides a good workout but doesn’t take too much out of me for the day. I finish with a post-workout protein shake.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>I’m using 30DWC as my push to kickstart a writing habit. To achieve this I’ve modified my morning routine to allow me to write for around an hour on the days I allocated to writing. Only after I’ve meditated do I wake my computer and start writing. Unless I’m doing research I open iaWriter in full screen mode to avoid distractions.</p>

<h2 id="shepherding-the-flock">Shepherding the flock</h2>

<p>The rest of house will start to wake between 6:30 and 7am most days so 7am - 8:30am is spent getting myself ready and then making breakfast for us all whilst my wife gets herself and the kids ready. Weekdays my wife and I will have scrambled egg (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0">Gordon Ramsay style</a>) or a home-made “quiche”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> as part of our slow-carb diet. I’ll prepare my lunch for work - either soup or salad - and herd the kids out the door before heading to the office.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>It’s not your typical quiche, but I don’t know how else to describe it. It’s egg, mushrooms, garlic, onions, broccoli, sometimes chicken, and cottage cheese cooked in a low oven for about an hour. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
