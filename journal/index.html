      <span class="posts-archive__date">08 Dec 2008</span>
      Setting up a remote repository for Git is really easy, but who wants to type things unnecessarily? Tonight I knocked up a task for Capistrano which gitify’s your current directory then creates a remote git repository and pushes to it. It’s based...

      I’ve always enjoyed art and design and wasn’t too bad at it, though never quite as good as I wanted to be. For quite a while through high school I was interested in becoming an Architect hopeful that it would satisfy my...

      At work we use quite a few 37signals products to manage our internal processes and client projects, one of which is Backpack. 37signals recently introduced a new feature, Journal, for tracking what you’ve done and what you’re currently doing which we’re trying...

      In an attempt to ensure that I keep this blogging lark up, I thought I would resurrect an old post I made a couple of years ago to a now defunct blog to serve as a starting point and thus I’ll revisit...

      <span class="posts-archive__date">26 May 2008</span>
      Finally gotten around to updating my site to consolidate everything into one place. I spent a bit of time deciding what to do –should I just go “old school” and hand code everything, or should I write my own little blogging tool?...

      Well apparently I can claim a first - for being spammed through ma.gnolia! Yes, apparently nowhere is safe from spam now. Today I received a message within ma.gnolia (the really nice bookmarking website, for those of you who don’t know) from member...

      Nothing exciting (for most people) but I’ve just finally found an easy way to stop creating the useless .ds_store files on non-mac network shares so I’m putting the info here for my posterity. http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301711 Open the Terminal Type: defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores...

      I’ve recently discovered TextMate from www.macromates.com - a superb text editor, previously I’ve been using TextWrangler but I’m slowly using TextMate more and more, one of it’s really great features is it’s expandability through the use of bundles. In getting to grips...

      Well looks like PC World have managed to pull off a bit of a coup - but they’re keeping it a bit quiet. Whilst some have managed to get Windows XP running on the new Intel based Mac’s, PC World have managed...

      Ok, I just read this article TidBITS: From iPod to MacBook Pro: A Switcher’s Tale and it pretty much sounds like me and my view on the whole switching to Apple thing. I’m not a total mac zealot but I do think...

      Wow, another week has flown by, nothing great to report other than I’ve found another rss news reader which I’m trying out. (Endo for anyone who’s interested) plus I’m also trying out Wordpress to see the differences between that and Blogger. Ok,...

      Well as promised I said I would say a little more about the various apps I’ve found recently. I should note that I’m a mac user so these are all either mac specific or are web applications - so Windows users, go...
