Lately I’ve been thinking about motivation and how you make progress on your goals. In a week of serendipitous moments, I happened to [read an article](https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-stay-motivated-when-youre-not-making-any-money) by Amy Hoy and listened to a podcast with Jocko Wilink who both talked about this topic.

My dictionary says the definition for _motivation_ is:

_a reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way_

Yet you see people asking the same questions again and again:

How do I get motivated?
How do I stay motivated [especially when times are tougher]?

The answer should be self-evident, your goal you said you want to achieve is the reason. What you’re saying, is I don’t feel like doing the work I know I must do to achieve my goal. You’re hoping that someone has that “one weird trick” which magically gets the work done.

Amy Hoy points out that motivation is a feeling, not a state of being. You do things when you feel motivated. You do things when you’re not motivated. For example she says, you don’t just feed your pets or children when you feel motivated to do so. So you should treat your business or your goals in the same way.

I haven’t kept my own business running for 14 years because I wake up highly motivated each day.

If you want that “one weird trick”, it’s simply to show up every day and do the work. It’s not sexy; it’s not glamorous and it isn’t always easy.

As Jocko puts it “Don’t count on motivation, count on discipline”. The discipline of getting up every day and going to work. There’s no shortcuts, you just have to make yourself do the work. Waiting to be motivated is just a form of procrastination. And the best cure for that is to get to work.

Create yourself a process or system to make it easier to get to work. You want to write? Set yourself up to make it easier to sit down and start writing. Clear your desk, set out your clothes and go to bed early. Then you can get up an hour earlier, get dressed and sit down and start writing. Write anything, it doesn’t matter. Even if you throw 99% of it away, you’ll still have made progress. You’ll have 100% more writing than if you are just waiting around until you are in the mood to write or inspiration hits you in the face. Make it a routine and a habit.

Jocko (as usual) says it best:

> “If you don’t feel like writing, or painting, or composing [or whatever], it doesn’t matter – you do it anyways!” 


Stoicism - I believe the best way to handle “failures” is to think about what you learned from the experience. They aren’t so much “failures” as “learning experiences.” And in business I find that to be particularly true.
