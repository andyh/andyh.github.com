Wow, another week has flown by, nothing great to report other than I've found *another* rss news reader which I'm trying out.  ([Endo](http://kula.jp/software/endo/) for anyone who's interested) plus I'm also trying out Wordpress to see the differences between that and Blogger.

Ok, the real reason for this post is just to note that I found out today that anyone who has a googlemail.com account with Google can still claim they have a gmail.com address and use it.  I'm sure this isn't secret at all (all I did was notice the headers of some mails sent to me through googlemail) but it's good to know, googlemail just doesn't have the same ring to it as gmail.  Maybe, at some point we'll lose the ability (if Google loses it's legal battle) but for now it works.
