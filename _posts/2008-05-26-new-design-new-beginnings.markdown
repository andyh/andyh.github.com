Finally gotten around to updating my site to consolidate everything into one
place. I spent a bit of time deciding what to do --should I just go "old
school" and hand code everything, or should I write my own little blogging tool?
In the end, as much as I quite fancied writing my own blogging tool I have too
little time on my hands to do that and plenty of other projects that I'd rather
be working on, so I plumped for WordPress, as it's one I've used before and the
newest version is pretty nice to use. And it's easy to get set up.

So, here's to new beginnings and a hope that I will keep this site much more up
to date with my thoughts and perhaps even a few articles...
