Well apparently I can claim a first - for being spammed through ma.gnolia!  Yes, apparently nowhere is safe from spam now.

Today I received a message within ma.gnolia (the really nice bookmarking website, for those of you who don't know) from member donco.  I've posted a screenshot of the message for posterity. ![Magnolia Spam](/images/magnolia-spam.jpg)

An a related note, I'm in the closing stages of putting together a widget for Mac OS X Tiger to quickly search just your own ma.gnolia bookmarks.  When it's done I'll put it on my website for download and maybe see if I can get it listed on ma.gnolia itself.  Speaking of websites, I'm also just getting my actual site up (www.elaptics.co.uk) if you want to see it in it's current part-finished state. And that's my rubbish excuse for not keeping this blog up to date!
