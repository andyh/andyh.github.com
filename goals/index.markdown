# Personal Goals for 2015

These are my personal goals for this year; some of the books on my reading list relate to various goals I have for my business but I've consolidated them here for completeness.

## Fitness

* Cycle 500 miles
* Row 500 miles
* Reduce Body Fat (%) to 15%
* Increase lean muscle mass and strength[^lmm]
  * Be able to do at least 25 repetitions of a double-hand swing of a 24kg kettlebell
  * Be able to do at least 5 strict (deadhang) pull-ups

[^lmm]: I'm not sure how best to measure this objectively and how I should best set goals for this. For now I'm aiming at being able to do certain things that I simply can't do right now (at the start of 2015) 

## Learning

* Complete a code kata each week
* Read (or re-read) books already bought -- see [book list](#booklist) below
* Implement small side project using DCI techniques and blog about it
* Write at least 2 blog posts per month
* Learn to cook
* Improve photography techniques
