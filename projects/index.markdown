Probably best to check back soon, in the meantime have a look on [github](http://github.com/andyh)

# Projects

Listed below are my current and past projects that I have worked on and released for public consumption.

**TextMate TYPO3 Bundle** (now available in the Macromates subversion repository)

**TextMate Snipplr Bundle** - I wrote this to provide a quicker way to access Snipplr using its API through TextMate mainly as a way to learn some Ruby so it includes my Ruby wrapper to Snipplr (now superseded by a new Snipplr bundle from Snipplr directly)

**ma.gnolia Search Widget** - A little Mac OS X Dashboard widget I wrote for accessing my ma.gnolia bookmarks.
